# iMapDB 

## Inspiration
As a computer science student who's also pursuing film as a second major, I wanted to build something that would link the two industries together. I've always been the type to track where movies are being filmed to get a sense of what the scenes might look like, so I decided to make a way to view all of these locations on a map. - Sanfeng

## What it does
Users can enter a movie title into our search bar to find out the filming locations. The locations will then display on the map.

## How we built it
We built the front end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and the back end through Node.js. We made use of myapifilms for the filming data, and Google Maps api to display it. We deployed the app using AWS.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we ran into was connecting the frontend with the backend. Everyone on our team had only ever worked on one end at a time, so it was definitely a bit of a learning experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of


## What we learned
We learned how to use new APIs, such as the Google Maps API and the iMDb database. We also learned how to connect the frontend and the backend.

## What's next for iMapDB
